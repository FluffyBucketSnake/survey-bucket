# Survey Bucket

A simple and open-source software for making and managing surveys. It's composed of two services:

- **Back-end**: which holds the actual logic and data management as well as the *API*, developed with *Node.js*, *Express.js* and *MongoDB*;
- **Front-end**: an user-facing implementation of a *Survey Bucket API* client, developed with *React* and *Material UI*.

This project is mostly created for practicing full stack development with the *MERN* stack. It's inspired by the [Survey App](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/3-Advanced/Survey-App.md) app idea.
